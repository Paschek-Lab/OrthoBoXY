# How to create MD simulation boxes with defined box length ratios using GROMACS’ “deform” feature
Simulation boxes with a certain box lengths ratios can be created starting
from a single simulation box by morphing the box in a volume-preserving fashion using short nonequilibrium MD simulation runs and employing GROMACS’ “deform” feature.

This folder exemplarily contains the input files for the creation of an orthorhombic MD cell with $L_x\neq L_y \neq L_z$ and $\frac{L_y}{L_z} = \frac{L_x}{L_y}=0.65$ from a simulation box with $L_x = L_y = 2.48582$ nm and $L_z = 7.45747$ nm, containing 1536 TIP4P/2005 water molecules at a density of $\rho = 0.9972$ g cm$`^{−3}`$ at 298 K. The corresponding start configuration is stored in [START.gro](START.gro) and the corresponding force field parameters can be found in [topol.top](topol.top). Since the volume shall be preserved, the desired new box vectors after the deformation process are $L_x=2.33036$ nm, $L_y=3.58517$ nm and $L_z=5.51565$ nm. The simulation length is 200 ps, thus the deformation rate in $x$-direction is -0.15545662 nm/ps, in $y$-direction 1.09935443 nm/ps and in $z$-direction -1.9418170 nm/ps, as indicated in the [SIMXX.mdp file](SIMXX.mdp). The final box configuration is stored in [sim1.gro](sim1.gro)
